# What is the SpRouter project?
The SpRouter project is an open-source effort to bridge the gap between the humble Router and the much more capable Spindle. Born out of the world of CNC woodworking, the Spindle -> Router aka "SpRouter" aims to provide the beneficial features of a Spindle unit to an off-the-self Router. 

<ins>These features include:</ins>
1. Accurate cutter RPM measurement and display.
2. Relative cutter load.
3. Remote control of cutter speed from main CNC controller.
4. Manual control of cutter speed from the SpRouter front panel.

The initial version of the SpRouter was designed for use with the OneFinity Elite Woodworker model CNC gantry and the Makita RT0701C router but could be adapted for use with other CNC machines and routers since the basic operating principles are largely the same, just presented in a different form factor.

<ins>Included in this repository are:</ins>
1. The KiCAD design files and BOM's for the circuit boards.
2. Design files for the various 3D printed components.
3. List of additional hardware and parts needed for assembly.
4. Design calculations and notes.
5. Wiki for installation, integration, and use of device.

All of the necessary information to make the SpRouter yourself is contained in this repository, however if would prefer to simply buy a prebuilt kit, it can also be purchased in the two forms described below. Check us out at [www.sprouterusa.com](url) for the best and most exclusive deals!

Form #1 is a "DIY" kit that contains the SpRouter and all the necessary cables and hardware needed to install it as one would expect. However, since the installation requires a small amount of soldering to wires inside the Router housing we also offer a second form where the necessary modifications inside the router have already been performed by us. Thus, form #2 contains the SpRouter and all the necessary cables and hardware in addition to a brand new, yet modified Makita RT0701C router.
