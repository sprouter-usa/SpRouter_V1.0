The SpRouter project is an open-source effort to bridge the gap between the humble Router and the much more capable Spindle. Born out of the world of CNC woodworking, the Spindle -> Router aka "SpRouter" aims to provide the beneficial features of a Spindle unit to an off the self Router. These features include:

1. Accurate cutter RPM measurement and display.
2. Relative cutter load.
3. Remote control of cutter speed from main CNC controller.
4. Manual control of cutter speed from the SpRouter front panel.

The initial version of the SpRouter was designed for use with the OneFinity Elite Woodworker model CNC router and the Makita RT0701C router but could be adapted for use with other CNC machines and routers since the basic operating principles are largely the same, just presented in a different form factor.

Included in this repository are:
1. The KiCAD design files and BOM's for the circuit boards.
2. The .STL files for the various 3D printed housings and components.
3. List of additional hardware and parts needed for assembly.
4. Design calculations and notes.
5. Wiki for installation, integration, and use of device.
